Q.1 Whatis Emment?
Emmet is a tool that helps you write HTML and CSS code faster. You type short shortcuts, and Emmet automatically turns them into full code. For example, instead of typing out a long list in HTML, you can type a simple abbreviation, press a key (like Tab), and Emmet will expand it into the full code. It saves time and makes coding easier.



Q.2 Difference between library and Framework?
The main difference between a library and a framework is in how they are used and how much control they give to the developer.
1. Library:
Definition: A library is a collection of pre-written code that you can use to perform common tasks.
Control: You have full control of your application, and you call the functions or methods from the library whenever you need them.
Example:
jQuery (for simplifying JavaScript DOM manipulation).
React (for building user interfaces; it’s technically a UI library).
Analogy: Using a library is like going to a toolbox and choosing which tool you need to complete the task.
2. Framework:
Definition: A framework provides a structured foundation for building applications. It gives you a skeleton where the framework itself calls your code and handles much of the application flow.
Control: The framework is in control, and you follow its structure and rules. You only fill in specific parts of the code.
Example:
Angular (for building front-end web applications).
Express (for building back-end web applications).
Django (for building full-stack web applications).
Analogy: Using a framework is like working inside a pre-built house. You have to work within the rules of the house, and it determines how things should be done.

Key Differences:
Inversion of Control: In a framework, the flow of control is dictated by the framework (often called "Hollywood Principle": “Don’t call us, we’ll call you”). In a library, you call the code as needed.
Flexibility: A library is more flexible—you decide how to integrate it. A framework is less flexible, as it enforces certain structures and rules.



Q.3 Why is React Known as React?
React is called "React" because it is designed to efficiently react to changes in data. The name reflects its core functionality: it reacts to state changes by updating the user interface (UI) in response to those changes in an efficient way.



Q.4 What is crossorigin in Script tag?
The crossorigin attribute in the <script> tag is used when loading scripts from a different website or domain (cross-origin). It tells the browser how to handle these requests, especially for security purposes like verifying that the script hasn’t been tampered with.



Q.5 Difference in React and ReactDOM.
React is the library for building components and managing the application's logic.
ReactDOM is the tool that renders those components to the browser and updates the DOM.
In a React app, you typically use React to build components and ReactDOM to render them on the web page.



Q.6 What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
Use react.development.js for debugging and development.
Use react.production.js when deploying your app to users to ensure it's optimized and efficient.



Q.7 What is async and defer?
Use async for scripts that don’t depend on others and can run independently without affecting the DOM.
Use defer for scripts that need the whole document to be parsed before running (like DOM manipulation).
